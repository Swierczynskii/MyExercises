# Advent of Code exercises

Repository made purely just to store solutions for simple tasks from [AdventCode](https://adventofcode.com/)

Solutions are provided in:
  - python
  - C++
  - Oracle 19c SQL
  - PL/SQL

I am not participating in the AdventCode, just doing those tasks as a form of exercise.
